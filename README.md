Strong is basically bold, there are some differences between the 2, but none that ive noticed. To use strong, you have to use the key &lt;strong> and everything you want to be strong bold inside and then close it. I personally dont see any difference between bold and strong, but apparently there is some difference, which you can google and see what it is.
